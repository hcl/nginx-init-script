# Init.d Script of Nginx for CentOS 6

Modified from the official [Nginx init.d Script](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/redhatnginxinit/). 

The official one is used by the official rpm package. In order to use it by the compiled Nginx, I made some modifications. 

PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS SUITABLE FOR YOUR COMPILATION VERSION BEFORE USE IT.
